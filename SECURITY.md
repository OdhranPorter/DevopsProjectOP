# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are committed to ensuring the security of our project. Security patches and updates will be applied to the following branches:

| Branch | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| `main` | :white_check_mark: |
| All other branches / versions | :x: |

Only the latest commit on the `main` branch is considered supported. Vulnerabilities found in older commits or other branches should be reported, but patches will only be applied to `main`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security reports seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, please report the vulnerability privately in one of the following ways:

1.  **(Preferred)** By using GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" feature, which you can find on the "Security" tab of this repository.
2.  By emailing us at: **[Odhranporter28@gmail.com]**

### What to Expect

When you report a vulnerability, we will do our best to:

* Acknowledge receipt of your report within **[48 hours]**.
* Provide a non-automated response with our initial assessment.
* Keep you informed of our progress as we investigate and (if necessary) fix the issue.
* Credit you for the discovery (if you wish) once the vulnerability has been patched and publicly disclosed.
